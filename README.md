# Automated Textual Response System using Deep Neural Networks(QA)

Abstract: Find answer to the question from the given context(paragraph). 

Using pre-trained BERT transformer `bert-based-uncased`, we've fine tuned it for question and answering system, using SQuAD-v2 dataset.

The model built, takes input in form of a simple plain-text, json and also pdf document.
  - UI for this implementation has been built using streamlit

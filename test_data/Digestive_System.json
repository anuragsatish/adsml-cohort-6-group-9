          "context": "The human digestive system is a complex series of organs and glands that processes food. It begins in the mouth, where food is chewed and mixed with saliva to begin the breakdown process. From there, food passes through the esophagus into the stomach, where gastric juices further digest it. The partially digested food moves into the small intestine, where most nutrient absorption occurs with the help of enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver. The liver produces bile, which is stored in the gallbladder and released as needed to digest fats. Water and remaining nutrients are absorbed in the large intestine. Finally, waste is expelled through the rectum and anus. The entire process is essential for converting food into energy and nutrients for the body.",

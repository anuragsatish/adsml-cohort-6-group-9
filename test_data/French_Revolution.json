          "context": "The French Revolution was a period of major social and political upheaval in France from 1789 to 1799. It began due to widespread economic hardship, social inequality, and a desire for more democratic governance. The storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, is often considered the symbolic beginning of the revolution. The revolution led to the end of absolute monarchy and the rise of the French Republic. King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette were eventually executed. During the radical phase known as the Reign of Terror, thousands were executed by guillotine under the leadership of Robespierre. The revolution significantly influenced global political thought and paved the way for Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s rise to power.",

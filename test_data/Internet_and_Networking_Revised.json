          "context": "The Internet is a global network that connects millions of computers and devices worldwide, enabling the transfer of data and communication. Each device connected to the Internet is assigned a unique IP address, which allows it to be identified on the network. Routers are essential network devices that direct traffic between different networks and ensure data reaches the correct destination. Modems connect a home or business to the Internet service provider. A Local Area Network (LAN) is a group of interconnected computers within a limited area, such as a home, school, or office. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses. Data sent over the Internet is broken into packets and reassembled at the destination. Protocols like HTTP and HTTPS are used to access websites, ensuring structured communication.",

          "context": "Mount Everest is the tallest mountain on Earth, standing at 8,848 meters above sea level. It is part of the Himalayas and is located on the border between Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. Everest attracts climbers from around the world due to its extreme altitude and challenging conditions. The first successful ascent was made in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa of Nepal. The mountain poses several hazards, including altitude sickness, extreme weather, and the risk of avalanches. Despite these dangers, it remains a symbol of achievement for mountaineers. Base camps on both the Nepalese and Tibetan sides support climbers as they acclimatize before attempting the summit. Everest plays a significant role in Nepal\u2019s tourism industry and has cultural significance for local communities.",

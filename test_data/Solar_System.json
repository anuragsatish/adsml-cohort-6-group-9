The eight planets\u2014Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune\u2014revolve around the Sun in elliptical orbits. The four inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) are rocky and smaller, while the four outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) are much larger and composed primarily of gases and ices. The asteroid belt, located between Mars and Jupiter, contains numerous irregularly shaped bodies. The Solar System also includes dwarf planets like Pluto, moons orbiting the planets, and small bodies such as comets and meteoroids. The Sun, a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, serves as the primary energy source for life on Earth. It accounts for over 99% of the total mass of the Solar System.",

The planets in order from the Sun are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Each planet has unique characteristics. Jupiter is the largest planet, while Mercury is the smallest. Earth is the only known planet to support life. The asteroid belt lies between Mars and Jupiter. Dwarf planets, such as Pluto and Ceres, are also part of the solar system. Moons orbit most of the planets, with Jupiter and Saturn having the most. Comets are icy bodies that release gas and dust, forming a glowing coma and tail as they approach the Sun.",
